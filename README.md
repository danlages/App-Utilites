# App-Utilites
Useful IOS application componants that I have implemented.   

# 1. Location Manager
Serves to determine co-ordinates based upon address of desired location. Distance is then determined between mobile device and co-ordinates. 

# 2. Scroll View Positioning upon User Input
Simple and well documented code serving to determine when keyboard or UI picker appears. Upon the presentation of the keybaord/picker, the scroll view will move up in co-ordination with the chosen 'contentInset' size.
